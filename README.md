# Geospatial-Analysis---Python-Eda
Used libraries like Geopy and Folium to perform geospatial analysis and performed extensive EDA to extract insights from the given dataset

• Performed data preprocessing and transformation with pandas to evaluate delivery and rating metrics over time.
• Visualized Seaborn scatterplot to perform bivariate analysis between cost and rating to derive a relationship
between the two.
• Utilized the Nominatim geocoder against restaurant instances, to generate folium heatmaps to study cuisine and
budget distribution across various locations.
